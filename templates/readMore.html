    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this research is to create a precise and trustworthy machine learning model for the
      early diagnosis of heart disease and diabetes in patients. Heart disease is the world's biggest
      cause of death and includes illnesses including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction,
      and congestive heart failure. However, due to its complex nature and the existence of various risk
      factors, diagnosing heart disease can be difficult. On the other hand the global prevalence of
      diabetes is rising quickly. By merging the findings of several machine learning techniques, the
      goal of this study is to create a system that can accurately predict a patient's early onset of
      diabetes and heart disease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our project intends to address this issue by utilising machine learning techniques to analyse and
      forecast the likelihood of those diseases in individuals based on a collection of clinical and
      demographic variables. The system should be able to classify patients as either having heart disease or
      not, based on the available data , like restecg, exang, cholesterol level etc or patients either having
      diabetes or not based on the available data like age, hypertension, bmi, blood glucose level etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system would build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the chances of heart
      disease and diabetes in an individual human being based either on the previous data or by taking the data
      from the user. After taking the dataset we applied the model over it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This model contain various types of data, such as numerical, categorical, and binary, and should be
      trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure its effectiveness.The project aims to utilize machine
      learning algorithms, such as logistic regression , decision tree model and random forest model.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Detect the presence or risk of heart disease and diabetes in patients based on their medical attributes or reports.</li>
      <li>Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with those diseases using various classification machine learning algorithms.</li>
      <li>It also be used in predicting those diseases by building an optimized model with the help of machine learning algorithms.</li>
      <li>Use data analysis and predictive analytics to prepare data for modeling, training, confusion matrix, and predictions.</li>
    </ol>
